# Modeling disease outbreaks

Implements SIR (Susceptible Infected Recovered) model variants for modeling disease outbreaks.  Also has some simulation tools for outbreaks using spatial information.

Very much a work in progress.

TODO:

- Layer information about severity
- Add testing regime
- Add ability to estimate parameters from observed data
- Check dataset
